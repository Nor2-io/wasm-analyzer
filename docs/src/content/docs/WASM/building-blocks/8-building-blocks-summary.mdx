- A module is divided into several possible _known sections_, dedicated to different kinds of functionality.
- The *Imports* section contains the external *functions*, *tables*, *memories* and *globals* a Wasm module or component requires.
- The *Exports* section contains the *functions*, *tables*, *memories* and *globals* a Wasm module or component exposes to external code.
- _Functions_ in WebAssembly are the same as functions, methods, or subroutines in most programming languages. Functions are defined in the *Functions* section of a WebAssembly Module.
- WebAssembly *Tables* are similar to arrays of *function* references. A *Table* is defined in the *Table* section of a WebAssembly Module.
- *Memories* are buffers that are used by WebAssembly code for data storage. *Memories* can be shared. *Memories* are defined in the *Memory* section of a WebAssembly Module.
- Modules may also contain *Custom Sections*. *Custom Sections* aren't standardized, and they may contain all sorts of information, like debugging information, or metadata.
