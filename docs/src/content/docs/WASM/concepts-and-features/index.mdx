description: "Describing WebAssembly concepts"
---

In the documents of this section, you'll find a brief overview of some of the larger concepts and features of the WebAssembly ecosystem. What's written here isn't meant to make you an expert on Wasm, but rather, it's a brief primer or refresher on some of the basics, intended to help you understand what the Nor<sup>2</sup> [WASM Analyzer](/) shows you.
