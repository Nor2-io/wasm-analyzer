description: "Describing WebAssembly modules"

In WebAssembly, everything is organized into stateless objects called _modules_. The Wasm code that makes up a module is divided into multiple sequential sections. The code is compiled by the browser, and modules are instantiated through the _WebAssembly.Module()_ method.

## Sections

<br />

The following table shows the known possible sections that can be part of a Wasm module:

| name           | contents                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| _Code_         | Holds the body of every function listed in the _Function_ section.                               |
| _Data_         | Declares the data that will be loaded into the _Memory_ section.                                 |
| *Function*\*   | Lists all the functions in the module.                                                           |
| *Global*\*     | Defines global variables for the module.                                                         |
| *Import*\*     | Lists all the imports used by the module.                                                        |
| _Element_      | Declares the data that will be loaded into the _Table_ section.                                  |
| *Export*\*     | Lists all the exports that will be exposed to the host environment from inside the module.       |
| *Memory*\*     | Holds the linear memory used by an instance of the module.                                       |
| _Start_        | Declares the index of a function that is executed as a Wasm module is instantiated.              |
| *Table*\*      | Holds a typed array of references to items that can't be stored as raw bytes in linear memory.   |
| _Type_         | Lists all signatures for functions the module uses. A signature can be shared between functions. |

In addition to the known sections listed above, a Wasm module may also contain one or more _custom sections_ that add non-standard functionality. Custom sections must appear after the _Data_ section in a module.

Read more about the contents of the various sections, and the building blocks of a module in the [Building blocks section](/wasm/building-blocks/) of this documentation.
