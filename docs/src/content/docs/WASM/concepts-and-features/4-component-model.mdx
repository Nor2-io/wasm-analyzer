The _WebAssembly component model_ is intended to make Wasm usable outside of a browser. The idea is to add a component layer that makes underlying Wasm functionality accessible in languages like C++ and Rust. The component model is part of the _WebAssembly System interface_ (WASI) project.

## Components

<br />

Wasm _components_ are kind of like stateless executable files, wrapping one or more modules. From the outside, a component may appear to be a Wasm module in its own right, containing one or more subordinated modules. A component is defined using the _Wasm Interface Type_ (WIT) text format, which you can read more about in our document on the subject, [here](/wasm/concepts-and-features/5-wit).
