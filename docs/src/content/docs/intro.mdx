## Intended audience

These documents are written for developers, solutions architects and others working with the technical side of WebAssembly.

<br />

## Requirements

Before reading, it is recommended that you have some familiarity with WebAssembly, and its basic building blocks.

But never fear–if you ARE unfamiliar with these concepts you'll find our own WebAssembly overview, [here](WebAssembly.mdx). In addition, **Mozilla**’s excellent WebAssembly docs are available [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly), and you can also have a look at the equally excellent **WebAssembly Community Group**'s documentation, [here](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/index.html). If you're interested in DWARF debugging information in WebAssembly files, have a look at our DWARF document, [here](DWARF.mdx).

<br />

## Purpose

This documentation describes a new tool–The Nor2 WASM Analyzer–that gives users an overview of WebAssembly _.wasm files_, including, but not limited to, data belonging to the recent metadata specification, as per [this](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/registry/discussions/116) [**ByteCodeAlliance**](https://bytecodealliance.org/) discussion on Github.

<br />

## These documents do not delve deeply into the following:

- General WebAssembly specifications and concepts
- Programming concepts
- API specifications

<br />
