Let's have a look at the Nor<sup>2</sup> WASM Analyzer: In a simple, user-friendly interface, we provide you with the means to get an overview of your WebAssembly files and packages. Where previously you might have had to go through a convoluted process involving a few tools or converting your .wasm files to a different format in order to get information about its properties, we'll now be doing the job for you, providing you with easy-to-read information in a simple, but effective, unified interface.

Primarily, The _WASM Analyzer_ came about as the solution to a problem we've seen with the WebAssembly ecosystemâ€”It is occasionally very hard to find information about the capabilities of a WebAssembly file. With the WASM Analyzer, anyone will be able to find information about the Imports, Exports and other properties of a given module or component, without having to use more than one tool or having to do any kind of file conversion or data extraction from a given file.

In giving the WASM Analyzer to the community, we also hope to encourage WebAssembly developers to think about adding more useful information to modules or components.

## Key features

The WASM Analyzer allows for two entry paths: You can either elect to browse for a WebAssembly .wasm file and open it, or you can open the Package Registry page, and pick a package to view from a given repository.

<br />

### Working with .wasm files

- First, you load up a _.wasm_ file you want to inspect, from the [start page](#getting-started-with-a-selected-wasm-file).
- Now, you'll find yourself on the WASM Analyzer [Metadata page](#landing-on-the-metadata-page).
- In the Metadata overview and Registry Metadata sections in the **Metadata** overview, you'll find representations of the various metadata attributes of the file.
- In the navigation sidebar, you'll find various navigation items. Clicking on these navigation items leads to more [pages](#pages), allowing you to view and work with specific aspects of the _.wasm_ file or package.

<br />

### Working with the Package Registry

- First, you click on the Package Registry button, on the [start page](#getting-started-with-the-package-registry).
- Now, you'll find yourself on the Package Registry page.
- If you want to view a list of packages from a different package _repository_, change the address in the address box.
- Search and filter packages using the filter option.

## Getting started with a selected .wasm file

<br />

To get started, it's as easy as clicking on the _Browse WASM file_ button:

![The WASM Analyzer start page](./images/webassembly_inspector_2.png)
_The Browse WASM file button_

<br />

From here, you can browse to and select a .wasm file you want to inspect:

<br />

## Getting started with the Package Registry

<br />

To get started, click on the :

![The WASM Analyzer start page](./images/webassembly_inspector_2.png)
_The Open Package Registry button_

<br />

From here, you can select a WebAssembly package you want to inspect:

![Choose a package through the list](./images/placeholder_1.png)
_Pick a WebAssembly package from the Package Registry list_

<br />

## Landing on the Metadata page

Once you've picked a file you want more information about, you'll find yourself on the Metadata page:

![The Metadata page](./images/webassembly_inspector_4.png)
_The Metadata page_

<br />

<br />

### The Metadata overview

In the Metadata overview, you'll find general information about your .wasm file:

![The WASM Analyzer Metadata overview](./images/webassembly_inspector_5.png)
_General WebAssembly package information on the WASM Analyzer Meta overview_

<br />

You'll be provided with a representation of the available metadata in your selected file or package. This information may include data such as the name<sup>1</sup>, size<sup>2</sup> (in bytes), and base64 representations of the _.wasm_ file hashes<sup>3</sup> in sha256 and sha512 formats. Furthermore, you may find information about which programming language<sup>4</sup> the item is based on, as well as the tools<sup>5</sup> used to build it, and any SDK<sup>6</sup> it was built on, if such information is available:

### Pages

You'll find additional information and functionality for working with the _.wasm_ file or package you've loaded, represented by navigation items on the sidebar.

Currently, the WASM Analyser has the following pages:

Some navigation items in the WASM Analyzer are only clickable if there are relevant entries for the WebAssembly module or component.
